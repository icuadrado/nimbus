Description: 
        Cumulus is an open source implementation of the Amazon S3 REST API.  It
        is packaged with the Nimbus (open source cloud computing software for
        science) however it can be used without nimbus as well.  Cumulus allows
        you to server files to users via a known and adopted REST API. You
        clients will be able to access your data storaging service with the
        Amazon S3 clients they already use.
        
        After installing this python package some additional system configuration is
        needed.
